            <h2>The target audience</h2>
            <p>As we carried out a survey we learned that the majority of people voted that this module would better suit a younger person. As younger people do generally adapt quicker and are more flexible, the job opportunities tend to be higher for a younger age group in this area. This is not to say that this module is only for younger people, but future careers is always of interest when studying a course in college.  </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Advantage: This course opens up alot of job opportunities in the IT industry, such as web design.</li>
                <li>Disadvantage: It is a very time consuming course and it needs alot of attention.</li> 
            </ol>
            <p>All in all this is a very interesting module that can really impress you with how diverse it can be and how endless the resources are. I would definetly advise this module to someone that likes a challenge and I would advise that you are quite familiar with computers, as it will make your life alot easier.</p>
