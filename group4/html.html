            <p>HTML is HyperText Markup Language, the 'language' of the world wide web. Hypertext is text which links to other text or links to another page. Markup is the code (‘tags’) used to give meaning to page content (text or images or video)and give it structures, e.g, defining a page header and paragraph text, also, showing finanical data in a table.</p>

                <h2>HTML Tags:</h2>
            <p>HTML tags are keywords used to define how web browsers format and display content. With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. They are keywords described by the HTML standard and are deonated angle brackets.</p>
            <ul>
                <li> < p >The tags make this a paragraph < / p > </li>
                <li> < h1 > This is a level 1 header < / h1 > </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most HTML tags, like the ones above, open and close. Other tags such as < br > (a line break), known as void elements, are self contained and not closed. Tags may contain attributes which are used to provide more information or content. The < img > tag has a src attribute that refers to the image to be displayed and alt for alternate text.</p>

            <h2>Some tips about HTML:</h2>
            <p>HTML pages are accessed from a webserver, however it can also be opened "locally" in a browser. By convention, the main or home page should be called index.html (Microsoft web servers use default.htm). Avoid spaces in HTML file names as it could be problematic when accessing from a web servers. The web server will expect spaces to be encoded as %20 in file names - more trouble than it's worth!. Also, when editing, it is important to close each tag immediately. E.g, follow < p > with < p > then fill in the gaps. It is also important to remember that most webservers are case sensitive with file names. Index.html is not the same as index.html. It's a good idea to adopt a naming convention.</p>
            <p>As a general rule use lower case for names and extensions, avoid spaces, and always follow the same naming convention, for example, Keep file names lower cased e.g index.html. If there is more than one word in the file name, seperate words by - e.g. contact-us.html. An alternative would be to use underscores_instead_of_spaces.html. When saving files, ensire that the text editor does not append . txt to the end. To view it, double click the file. This opens it in the default web browser</p>

            <h2>HTML - A First Page:</h2>
            <p>Start by creating a root directory for the site, e.g C:\VisDesUserExp\ firstSite\. Open a text editor and type the following, "Hello World, this is index.html". Last but not least, save the file as C:\VisDesUserExp\firstSite\index.html.</p>
