            <p>Ethnicity: Filipino</p>
            <p>Interests: Singing, drawing, dancing and baking</p>
            <p>Reason why you chose Computing: The reason why I chose Computing was because I had an interest in technology and I wanted to learn more about computers and how to create websites. I also wanted a course where I would have many Job opportunities after I graduate. I decided to study Computing with Language since I want to be able to study abroad so I chose to study German since I learned German in secondary school for five years. It would be cool if I had the chance to work in Germany after I graduate with my degree in Computing. Even if I had zero experience in coding, I am willing to learn new skills and be able to help my classmates if they struggle with maths since I am quite good at maths.</p>
